# Example Select Words Order

This example builds on what was introduced in the [Quickstart](/quickstart/) as well as the [Improve Order Quality](/improve_order_quality/) guide.

## Order description

Text to Speech is becoming increasingly important in the world of AI. With the select words order, we can test how understandable the AI generated speech is. We do that by asking the user to click on the words they hear in the audio. This can be done on a language basis, where we can target even uncommon languages and make sure the AI is pronouncing the words correctly.

```python
--8<-- "examples/select_words_order.py"
```

The resulting rapids for the users look like this:
