please note that there is the RapidataApiClient that wraps every api call to handel backend tracing and error handling.

The backend errors follow a specific format that you can see in the RapidataError class.

When building the docs make sure you use 'uv run --group docs mkdocs build' - otherwise check out the pyproject.toml file for the dependencies.

When writing documentation, make sure to keep focused, easy to understand, and not repeat information. it should highlight the capabilities while not overexaggerating or falling into hyperbole.
